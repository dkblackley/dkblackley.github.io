Recently I partook in Hack The Box's [Cyber Apocalypse](https://www.hackthebox.com/events/cyber-apocalypse-2023) Capture the flag event. It was remarkably fun and might even convince me to purchase a VIP subscription.

I didn't get much farther than some of medium challenges, but all challenges were at least intriguing. Though a lot of the challenges I knew how to do, it felt like (with the solution I had) it would be very tedious to extract the flag. Particularly looking at you, Reverse engineering... Perhaps my knowledge is outdated, or perhaps my tedious solution was the only one. I particularly enjoyed the Cryptography challenges and think I'll talk about them. Regardless, in the coming weeks I'll try to make a write up of each challenge, posting my methods and talking about the real solutions. This CTF has taken up a lot of my free time so it might take awhile before these write-ups come out, if I even find the time for them...

Next year I might try finding a team in their discord, as it stands, competing against teams of 20 players makes getting into the top 100 a challenge, especially with the game leaking over into working days. Regardless, Stay tuned folks.
